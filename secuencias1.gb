Summary: Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins,
are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes.
They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes
including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling,
neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Many of the effects of laminin
are mediated through interactions with cell surface receptors.
These receptors include members of the integrin family, as well as
non-integrin laminin-binding proteins. This gene encodes a
high-affinity, non-integrin family, laminin receptor 1. This
receptor has been variously called 67 kD laminin receptor, 37 kD
laminin receptor precursor (37LRP) and p40 ribosome-associated
protein. The amino acid sequence of laminin receptor 1 is highly
conserved through evolution, suggesting a key biological function.
It has been observed that the level of the laminin receptor
transcript is higher in colon carcinoma tissue and lung cancer cell
line than their normal counterparts. Also, there is a correlation
between the upregulation of this polypeptide in cancer cells and
their invasive and metastatic phenotype. Multiple copies of this
gene exist, however, most of them are pseudogenes thought to have
arisen from retropositional events. Two alternatively spliced
transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for
this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
Transcript Variant: This variant (1) represents the shorter
transcript and encodes the shorter isoform (1).

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs
to the S5P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the
cytoplasm. This gene shares sequence similarity with mouse LLRep3.
It is co-transcribed with the small nucleolar RNA gene U64, which
is located in its third intron. As is typical for genes encoding
ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of
this gene dispersed through the genome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit, where it forms part
of the domain where translation is initiated. The protein belongs
to the S3P family of ribosomal proteins. Studies of the mouse and
rat proteins have demonstrated that the protein has an
extraribosomal role as an endonuclease involved in the repair of
UV-induced DNA damage. The protein appears to be located in both
the cytoplasm and nucleus but not in the nucleolus. Higher levels
of expression of this gene in colon adenocarcinomas and adenomatous
polyps compared to adjacent normal colonic mucosa have been
observed. This gene is co-transcribed with the small nucleolar RNA
genes U15A and U15B, which are located in its first and fifth
introns, respectively. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal
proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene
dispersed through the genome. Multiple alternatively spliced
transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for
this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2012].
Transcript Variant: This variant (1) and variant 2 both encode the
same protein (isoform 1).

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs
to the S3AE family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the
cytoplasm. Disruption of the gene encoding rat ribosomal protein
S3a, also named v-fos transformation effector protein, in
v-fos-transformed rat cells results in reversion of the transformed
phenotype. This gene is co-transcribed with the U73A and U73B small
nucleolar RNA genes, which are located in its fourth and third
introns, respectively. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal
proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene
dispersed through the genome. Alternatively spliced transcript
variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May
2012].
Transcript Variant: This variant (1) encodes the longer isoform
(1).

Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and

protein S4 is the only ribosomal protein known to be encoded by
more than one gene, namely this gene and ribosomal protein S4,
Y-linked (RPS4Y). The 2 isoforms encoded by these genes are not
identical, but are functionally equivalent. Ribosomal protein S4
belongs to the S4E family of ribosomal proteins. This gene is not
subject to X-inactivation. It has been suggested that
haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal protein S4 genes plays a role
in Turner syndrome; however, this hypothesis is controversial. As

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs
to the S7P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the
cytoplasm. Variable expression of this gene in colorectal cancers
compared to adjacent normal tissues has been observed, although no
correlation between the level of expression and the severity of the
disease has been found. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal
proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene
dispersed through the genome. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a cytoplasmic
ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The
protein belongs to the S6E family of ribosomal proteins. It is the
major substrate of protein kinases in the ribosome, with subsets of
five C-terminal serine residues phosphorylated by different protein
kinases. Phosphorylation is induced by a wide range of stimuli,
including growth factors, tumor-promoting agents, and mitogens.
Dephosphorylation occurs at growth arrest. The protein may
contribute to the control of cell growth and proliferation through
the selective translation of particular classes of mRNA. As is
typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple
processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs
to the S15P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the
cytoplasm. The protein has been shown to bind to the 5.8S rRNA in
rat. The gene product of the E. coli ortholog (ribosomal protein
S15) functions at early steps in ribosome assembly. This gene is
co-transcribed with two U14 small nucleolar RNA genes, which are
located in its third and fifth introns. As is typical for genes
encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed
pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome. [provided by
RefSeq, Jul 2008].

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs
to the S11P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the
cytoplasm. Transcript variants utilizing alternative transcription
initiation sites have been described in the literature. As is
typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple
processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome. In
Chinese hamster ovary cells, mutations in this gene can lead to
resistance to emetine, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Multiple
alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein
have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
Transcript Variant: This variant (1) represents the longest
transcript.

Summary: Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis,
consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together
these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80
structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal
protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs
to the S19P family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the
cytoplasm. This gene has been found to be activated in various
tumors, such as insulinomas, esophageal cancers, and colon cancers.
As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are
multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the
genome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript
variants. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2015].
Transcript Variant: This variant (2) uses an alternate 5'-terminal
exon, which results in a different 5' UTR and use of an alternate
start codon compared to variant 1. It encodes isoform 2, which is
shorter than and has a distinct N-terminus compared to isoform 1.
